# HW07 - Business Corp Employee Management System
Name: Isaac Copeland
Date: 3/16/2022

## Required Files
* main.cpp: contains a testing algorithm that creates and test objects and their members
* Employee.h: contains definitions of base class Employee
* Employee.cpp: contains implementations of base class Employee
* Supervisor.h: contains definitions of derived class Supervisor
* Supervisor.cpp: contains implementations of derived class Supervisor
* Officer.h: contains definitions of derived class Officer
* Officer.cpp: contains implementations of derived class Officer
* Maintenance.h: contains definitions of derived class Maintenance
* Maintenance.cpp: contains implementations of derived class Maintenance
* Makefile: contains compilation instructions to properly compile all files

## Compilation Instructions
With a complete Makefile, compile by entering "make" on the command line. Executable "EmployeeTesting" will be produced.

## Program usage
"./EmployeeTesting" to run program after compilation in the terminal. The program expects no input.

## Notes
Any extra notes, such as:
* The tests for each object runs as expected.
* This program only supports 3 positions of Buisness Corp staff.
* The Maintenance class could have supported an access code, but simplicity limited it to the number of issues a maintenance employee has solved.
* The Maintenance class is an extra credit item.
