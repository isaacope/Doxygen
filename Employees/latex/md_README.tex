\doxysection*{Compilation Instructions}

With a complete Makefile, compile by entering \char`\"{}make\char`\"{} on the command line. Executable \char`\"{}\+Employee\+Testing\char`\"{} will be produced.

\doxysection*{Program usage}

\char`\"{}./\+Employee\+Testing\char`\"{} to run program after compilation in the terminal. The program expects no input.

\doxysection*{Notes}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The tests for each object runs as expected.
\item This program supports 3 positions of Buisness Corp staff.
\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{classMaintenance}{Maintenance}} class could have supported an access code, but simplicity limited it to the number of issues a maintenance employee has solved.
\item The \mbox{\hyperlink{classMaintenance}{Maintenance}} class is a new position offered at Businees Corp!
